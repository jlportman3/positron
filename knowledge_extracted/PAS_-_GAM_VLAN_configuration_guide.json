Summary   \nPositron GAM is a layer 2 network hardware  that allows the transport of VLANs  over existing coax or \ncopper twisted pairs . The present document  explain s in a few steps the provisioning of  VLANs in the  \nGAM  (Coax or Copper)  and the Subscriber to provide L2 end-to-end connectivity . \n \n2. GAM Solution Diagram  \nFigure 1 shows a typical topolo gy of a GAM solution  over coax or copper twisted pairs . The GAM is \nconnected to the network backbone  through the 10G port where VLANs are received and  mapped to the \nSubscribers on the Endpoint side.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1 GAM Solution diagram  \n \n3. GAM 10G Port Configuration  \nBefore adding VLANs it is necessary to set Speed  and Mode  on 10G port  of the GAM  at \nConfiguration →Ports (Ethernet)  as shown in figure below . If GPON  SFP adapter is installed \nin the GAM,  it is recommended  to select Auto  Speed option to make it link to 1 Gbps or 2.5 \nGbps if available. Auto  option works with 1 Gbps and 2,5 Gbps links only .  \nWhen using XGS -PON SFP+ adapter 10 Gbps FDX  option shall be selected.  \nPort Mode  is set to Uplink  by default, it means that t raffic flows to/from all other ports  (isolated, \ncommunity and stacking ports).  \n \n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n   GAM VLAN Configuration Guide  \nAugust 18, 2024  Positron Access Solutions  4 \n \n \nFigure 2 GAM 10G Port configuration  \n \n \n4. GAM 10G Port VLAN Configuration  \nOnce 10G port is  configured  we can  proceed with the provisioning of VLAN s, one or multiple VLANs can  \nbe configured  on 10G port of the GAM , GAM VLAN settings must match with the configuration of the \nprimary switch  connected to it. \n \nIn this section we show three typical ways to set VLANs on 10G port of the GAM that is facing the Primary \nSwitch : \na. One Untagged VLAN + Tagged VLANs : 10G port  of the GAM has an untagged VLAN attached \nto it (native VLAN) and additionally will transport some other tagged VLAN s as a Trunk port at the \nsame time.  \nb. All VLANs Tagged : 10G port of the GAM transport tagged VLAN only as a Trunk port.  \nc. Access mode : 10G port  of the GAM works  as an access port with an internal VLAN ID assigned \nto it. \n \n3.1 Untagged VLAN + Tagged VLANs  \n \nFor this case it is assumed that 10G port of the GAM will be connected to a switch to receive one \nuntagged VLAN + one or  multiple tagged VLANs.  \nIt is required to  go to  Configuration →VLANs→Configuration  to set Port 10G of the GAM to Trunk  \nMode  as shown in  Figure 3, it means that 10G port can  have more than one VLAN  assigned , Egress \nTagging  must be  set to Untag Port VLAN   to assign  VLAN ID 3 (used for this example) on column Port \nVLAN  as the untagged “native”  VLAN .  Allowed VLANs field is where we specify  the list or ranges of \nTagged VLANs allow ed on the 10G port . To enter  a range of VLANs a dash “ -“ is written between the first \nand last VLAN  of the range i.e. 3-4093 (means from 3 up to 4094), it is also possible to specify a few \nVLANs i.e. 3,200,250,3000,4000  with a maximum of 12 entries separated with commas “’,”. We can also \nhave  a combination of ranges of VLANS with single VLANs i.e. 3,200 -204,250,3000,4000.  \n Summary:  With settings shown in Figure 3 we have  VLAN 3 as Untagged VLAN on port 10G -1 and \nallowing VLAN range from 3 to 409 3 to pass through 10G -1 port as tagged VLANs.  \n \n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n   GAM VLAN Configuration Guide  \nAugust 18, 2024  Positron Access Solutions  5 \n \n \n \nFigure 3 Settings on 10G port Untagged VLAN and Tagged VLANs  \n  \n \n3.2 All VLANs Tagged  \n \nFor this case it is assumed that 10G port of the GAM will be connected to a switch  to receive one or \nmultiple tagged VLANs.  \nIt is required to go to Configuration →VLANs→Configuration  to set Port 10G of the GAM to  Trunk  \nMode as shown in  Figure 4, it means that 10G port can  have more than one VLAN  assigned , Egress \nTagging  must be  set to Tag All , it means that Port 10G will  expect tagged VLAN only,  then VLAN ID 3 \n(used for this example) on column Port VLAN  will be ignored.  Allowed VLANs field is where we specify  \nthe list or ranges of Tagged VLANs allow ed on the 10G port . To enter  a range of VLANs a dash “ -“ is \nwritten between the first and last VLAN  of the range i.e. 3-4094  (means from 3 up to 4094), it is also \npossible to specify a few VLANs i.e. 3,200,250,3000,4000  with a maximum of 12 entries separated with \ncommas “’,”. We can also have  a combination of ranges of VLANS with single VLANs i.e. 3,200 -\n204,250,3000,4000.  \n  \nSummary:  With settings shown in Figure 4 we are ignoring  VLAN 3 as Untagged VLAN on port 10G -1 \nand allowing VLAN range from 3 to 409 3 to pass through 10G -1 port as tagged VLANs.  \n \n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n   GAM VLAN Configuration Guide  \nAugust 18, 2024  Positron Access Solutions  6 \n \n \nFigure 4 Settings on 10G port for Tagged VLANs  only \n3.3  Access  mode  \n \nFor this case it is  assumed that 10G port of the GAM will be connected to an access port of a switch or to \na host.  \nIt is required to go to Configuration →VLANs→Configuration  to set Port 10G of the GAM to  Access  \nMode  as shown in  Figure 5, it means that 10G port has a single untagged VLAN , Egress Tagging  and \nAllowed VLANs will be grayed out . It is required to add VLAN ID (VLAN 3 used for this example) on \ncolumn Port VLAN , it will be the VLAN ID assigned internally to 10G port and this same VLAN ID  will be \nused to map traffic in  Subscribers, additionally we need to enter VLAN ID in Allowed Access VLANs . \n  \nSummary:  With these settings port 10G -1 will work as an access port using Port VLAN  (VLAN 3 ) \ninternally , we can use VLAN ID 3 in any subscriber to map the traffic from 10G port to a n Endpoint at \ncustomer  side. \n \n \nFigure 5 Settings on 10G port for Access Mode  \n\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n   GAM VLAN Configuration Guide  \nAugust 18, 2024  Positron Access Solutions  7 \n \n5. Subscriber  VLAN Configuration  \n \nOnce the VLANs are set in 10G port of the GAM it is necessary to set the VLANs on the Endpoint side  at \nthe Subscriber.  \n \nFigure 6 show s Subscriber configuration page  located at Configuratio n→G.hn→Subscriber , in this \nexample Endpoint is delivering VLAN 150 untagged in port GigE #1 and allowing tagged VLANs 1000, \n2000 and 3000  over the same port GigE #1 . These VLANs must be included in  the Allowed VLANs list on \n10G port.  \n  \n \nFigure 6 Subscriber configuration page  \n \n \n \nSubscriber Name:  This field is mandatory ; the name must be unique among all subscribers  and It must \ncontain between 1 and 31 characters.  \nDouble Tagging:  Enable 802.1ad QinQ  double tagging . \nVLAN: Is the main VLAN used to carry the subscriber traffic to port GigE #1 of the Endpoint , by default \nthis VLAN  is untagged, if we want  it to be tagged, it is necessary  to select Endpoint Tagging  flag. Valid \nvalues are 0 (disabled) and 3 to 4095.  \nRemapped VID:  If defined,  this i s the VLAN ID (C -TAG) used between the G.hn bridge (Endpoint) and \nthe GAM  \nEndpoint Tagging:  Enable or disable VLAN tag (C -TAG) at the subscriber endpoint. If disabled, the \ntraffic will be untagged at the subscriber end. If enabled, the VLAN tag will be kept (either the primary \nVLAN tag, or if set, the remapped VLAN tag).  \n\n\n--- Page 8 ---\n   GAM VLAN Configuration Guide  \nAugust 18, 2024  Positron Access Solutions  8 \n \nTrunk Mode:  Set port GigE #1 in tru nk mode assuming VLAN range 3 -4093 removing  Allowing Tagged \nVLAN  option  from the menu . \nAllowed Tagged VLAN:  Additional  VLANs that are allowed  in port GigE # 1 of the Endpoint . Those VLAN \nwill remain tagged. Note that there is no link between this field and the main VLAN field for this subscriber \n(the main VLAN will be used, and untagged, whatever the content of this field).  \nMultiple VLANs may be created by using a list syntax where the individual elements are separated by \ncommas. Ranges are specified with a dash separating the lower and upper bound.  \nThe following example will create VLANs 3, 10, 11, 12, 13, 200, and 300: 3,10 -13,200,300. Spaces are \nallowed in between the delimiters.  \nAllowed VLANs must be in range 3 to 4093.  You can enter up to 12 VLAN ID s.  \nBandwidth Plan:  Is the bandwidth plan selected for the Endpoint in port GigE #1. If set to \" Unthrottled\", \nthis subscriber will have no bandwidth limit restriction.  \nPort #2 VLAN:  Is the VLAN assigned to  port GigE #2  of the Endpoint , this VLAN will be untagged  only.  \nEndpoint:  The Endpoint assigned to this subscriber.  \nPoE:  Configure the PoE mode for the Endpoint  in port GigE #1, this feature is available only in G1002 -\nC+, G1002 -M+ and G2002 -M+ Endpoints . \nDescription:  An optional free -form description given to this subscriber.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"
