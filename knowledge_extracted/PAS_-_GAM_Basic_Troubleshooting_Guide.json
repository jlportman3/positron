The GAM is the most effective way to \nserve customers in brownfield buildings that were not able to be reached historically.  The GAM is a fiber \n(xPON / Active Ethernet) or fixed wireless access (FWA) solution that extends Gigabit services to places \nwithout disruption to the brownfield property.  \nThe GAM is the ideal distribution backbone for WiFi Access Points in brownfield hospitality and MDU \nbuildings, saving up to 75% in installation and equipment costs compared to a rewiring with Fiber to the \nDoor .  It dramatically accelerates the time to operation and eliminates disruption to guests and tenants . \nWith the GAM backbone connected to main distribution  switches and feeding  APs in the rooms, hospitality \nguests and MDU tenants can be assured of a secure, always -on, full property connectivity experience with \nsupport for advanced smart -building IoT devices and features.  \nAs a carrier -grade Ethernet Switch, the GAM support s multiple VLANs with strict Quality of Service (QOS) \nover the existing wiring  infrastructure  to provide Ethernet services to end users . \n2 G.hn Introduction  \nThe ITU -T G.9960 G.hn Wave -2 standard is designed to leverage the existing telephone, UTP, CAT -3 or \nCAT-5/5e/6 wiring, or RG -6/RG -11/RG -59 coaxial cable to deliver a Gigabit Internet service to each \nsubscriber.  Reuse of the existing wiring eliminates the complexity and delays associated with in -building \nfiber installation.  \nG.hn is used as an access technology by Broadband Service Providers (including telcos, cable companies, \nISPs, and WISPs) looking to extend Gigabit services serving properties via Fiber or FWA over the in -\nbuilding wiring.  G.hn is a highly scalable Ethernet  technology that greatly simplifies the access network \nand backend infrastructure. With G.hn, operators deliver advanced Gigabit internet and managed Wi -Fi \nwithout the high capital and operational expenses associated with a fiber retrofit.  \nA G.hn Access Multiplexer (GAM) operates as a Domain Master (DM) while the G,hn to Gigabit Ethernet \nbridge that connects to the AP operates as an Endpoint (EP).  \nEach G.hn subscriber port of an EP supports up to 1.7 Gbps of dynamically allocated bandwidth for near \nsymmetric Gigabit services.  Each G.hn link is encrypted with 128 -bit keys for additional security.  The GAM \noperates in point -to-point mode over telephone wiring and supports point -to-multipoint operation over \ncoaxial cabling by leveraging the existing CATV splitters and taps. The Positron GAM solution is ideally \nsuited to deliver reliable Ethernet services in MDU, MTU, and Hospitality deployments.  \nFurther information about G.hn  Technology  can be found here on the Positron website . \n  \n\n--- Page 4 ---\n   GAM Basic Troubleshooting  \nPositron Access Solutions  4  \n \n3 Conne cting to the GAM  \nThe management  of the GAM can be done through the Web UI of the GAM using a Web browser . \n \na. Connect a n RJ-45 UTP patch cord between  your PC and the  MGMT port of the GAM .  The location of \nMGMT port of the GAM is show n in Figure 1 with green lines . \n \nFigure 1 Location of IP MGMT port on the GAM \nb.

Once the Log On window  is display ed, use the following credentials:  \n \nUsername:  admin  \nPassword:  Blank (no password set  by default ) \ne. The main page of the GAM will be displayed as shown  below.  \n \n \nFigure 2 Main Page of the GAM -12-C \n   \n \n \n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n   GAM Basic Troubleshooting  \nPositron Access Solutions  5  \n \n4 Troubleshooting  \nIn this section we provide  a few basic troubleshooting procedure s that can be applied on a GAM solution.  \n \n4.1 Checking Endpoints  \nTo verify the status of Endpoints we need to be connected to the GAM Web UI  first.  Once there , we go to \nMonitor→G.hn→Overview .  For GAM solution over coax,  it is necessary to click on the          symbol to \nexpand the list of Endpoints in the GAM as shown in Figure 3.  For the  GAM solution over Copper \nTwisted Pairs , the MACs of Endpoints will be displayed immediately on the  G.hn Overview  page as \nshown in Figure 5.  \n \n \n \nFigure 3 Monitoring Endpoints in Coax GAM  \n \nGreen Status      means that the Endpoint is physically connected to the GAM and  the G.hn link is Up .  \nThe Endpoint Model will also  be displayed.  \n \n \n \nFigure 4 Checking Endpoint Status  in Coax GAM  \n \n \nClick Here  \nClick Here  \n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n   GAM Basic Troubleshooting  \nPositron Access Solutions  6  \n \n \n \nFigure 5 Checking Endpoint Status in Co pper Twisted Pairs  GAM  \n \n \nWe can get detailed information of the Endpoint b y clicking on  the Endpoint MAC address  as shown in \nFigure 4 and Figure 5.  \n \nAs displayed in Figure 6, we get detailed status of the Endpoint . \n \n \nFigure 6 Endpoint Detailed Status  \nUnder  the Link section we can  see the BW tha t an Endpoint can provide  and the status of GigE ports.  \n− Downstream PHY Allocated Bandwidth (Mbps):  Maximum  Downstre am BW (GAM to \nEndpoint) reached on G.hn link . \n− Upstream PHY Allocated Bandwidth (Mbps):  Maximum  Upstream BW (Endpoint to GAM) \nreached on G.hn link.  \n− Downstream Max Usable Data Throughput (Mbps):  Maximum  Downstream L2 Capacity (GAM \nto Endpoint).  \n− Upstream Max Usable Data Throughput (Mbps):  Maximum  Upstream L2 Capacity (Endpoint to \nGAM).  \n \nIt is very important to confirm that Downstream and Upstream BW values are symmetrical .  If numbers \nare asymmetrical,  it could be an indication of wiring issues , (bad connector, defective splitter/tap, etc.). \n \nThe PoE Section  applies only to  G1002 -C+/ G1002 -M+/G2002 -M+ Endpoints  models .  We can check  if \nthe PoE feature is enabled on GigE port #1 of the Endpoint and which of the two PoE standards  is being \nprovided (802.3af – 15W or 802.3at – 30W) . \n \nClick Here  \n\n--- Page 7 ---\n   GAM Basic Troubleshooting  \nPositron Access Solutions  7  \n \n4.2 Checking  G.hn SNR and Noise  \nSignal levels must be reviewed during installation of  the GAM solution to understand the quality of the \nG.hn link , and during troubleshooting to understand if physical connections between GAM and the \nEndpoints are performing well.  \n \nTo check signal levels , go to Diagnostics →G.hn→SNR PSD & Noise .  Once there it is necessary to \nselect G.hn port of the GAM and the MAC address of Endpoint that we are going to inspect .  Select \nDirection  of the signal Downstream  (GAM to Endpoint) and Upstream  (Endpoint to GAM) , select Type  \nof signal to monitor  and click on Start button  as shown in  2. SNR Probe  and Noise  are the most \nimportant signals to check . \n \nAs shown in the following figures, maximum SNR value is displayed in the graph in yellow . The GAM is \nconstantly measuring  the SNR  value  between the G.hn port and the Endpoint to keep it above 40dB  by \nadjusting AGC RX gain value displayed in white .  AGC RX range s from 18 to 62 dB .  \nWhen a GAM shows  42 dB or more of attenuation between the G.hn port and the Endpoint , we are going \nto see the AGC value reaching a maximum of 62 dB  and SNR  will start to show values under 40 dB.   \n \n \nFigure 7 Checking Upstream SNR  \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 8 Checking Upstream SNR  \n \nNoise graphs also display max value with yellow numbers .  It refers to the noise measure d on the  G.hn \nlink between GAM port and an Endpoint.  If noise levels are lower than -110 dB ( -111, -112… -120) it will \nClick Here  to Start/Stop  \nSNR  \nSNR  \nClick Here  to Start/Stop  \n\n--- Page 8 ---\n   GAM Basic Troubleshooting  \nPositron Access Solutions  8  \n \nnot impact the quality  G.hn link .  On the other hand , if we see noise levels with values higher than -110 \ndB (-109, -108… -100), it could impact the quality of the G.hn link.  \n \n \nFigure 9 Checking Downstream Noise  \n \n \nFigure 10 Checking Upstream Noise  \n \n4.3 Endpoint Firmware Issues  \nWe ma y see a warning icon       while checking Endpoint Status at Monitor→G.hn→Overview .  This \nsymbol means that the Endpoint is using an older FW version and needs to be updated from the GAM. \nSee Figure 11, Detailed Status of an Endpoint requiring to be updated.  \n \n \nFigure 11 Endpoint showing FW i nconsistence  \nClick Here to Start/Stop  \nClick Here to Start/Stop  \n\n--- Page 9 ---\n   GAM Basic Troubleshooting  \nPositron Access Solutions  9  \n \nTo update Endpoint Firmware , we can do it from  the GAM Web UI. First we go to  \nConfiguration →G.hn→Global Configuration , then we Enable  Endpoint Automatic Firmware \nUpgrade  feature as indicated  in Figure 12 and Figure 13.  Once enabled, the GAM will start to upgrade \nall the Endpoints  with the new FW .  Upgrade s take about two minutes,  and the Endpoint will reboot a \ncouple of times  during the  process .  \n \n \n \nFigure 12 Enabling Automatic FW Upgrade  of Endpoints in Copper Twisted Pair GAM  \n \nFigure 13 Enabling Automatic F W Upgrade of Endpoints  in Coax GAM  \nClick Here  \nClick Here  \n"
